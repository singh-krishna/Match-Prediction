# Match Prediction
From the data set, we had built the model using machine learning techniques which tells us about which team is going to win the match.
We extract the data from the data set which are required to build the model basically we preprocessed the data of the data set.
Then we apply logistic regression using sklearn to get the accuracy. And the accuracy of this model is 96.04%.
